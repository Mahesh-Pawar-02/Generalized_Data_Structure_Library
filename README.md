# Generalized Data Structure Library

This repository contains a **Generalized Data Structure Library** that provides implementations of various fundamental data structures, designed for efficiency and reusability across different applications.

## Features

- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Linked List**
- **Binary Tree**
- **Hash Table**
- **Graph**
- **Priority Queue (Heap)**

Each data structure is implemented with common operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal (where applicable).

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Data structures are implemented in Java, taking advantage of object-oriented design principles to create reusable and efficient components.
- **C & C++**: Data structures are implemented in C, taking advantage of object-oriented design principles to create reusable and efficient components.
  
## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mahesh-Pawar-02/Generalized_Data_Structure_Library.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd Generalized_Data_Structure_Library
Open the project in your preferred IDE (such as visual studio code).
Usage
You can directly use the data structures in your projects by importing the corresponding classes.

Usage
You can directly use the data structures in your projects by importing the corresponding classes. For example, to use the Insertion Sort:

```
void Insertion_Sort(int *arr,int size)
{
    int i = 0,j = 0,key = 0;
    for(i = 1;i < size;i++)
    {
        key = arr[i];
        j = i - 1;

        while(j >= 0 && arr[j] > key)
        {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j--;
        }
        arr[j + 1] = key;
    }
}
```
